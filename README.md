# Packet-tracer-enterprise-network
This project builds a small enterprise 3-tier network in Cisco Packet Tracer using a Core–Distribution–Access design. Five department LANs connect via four routers. OSPF runs in core/distribution, RIPv2 on access, with redistribution. Extended ACLs enforce isolation and required access. Routing and security were verified via testing.
